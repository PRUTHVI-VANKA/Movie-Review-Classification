# Movie-Review-Classification

This Python script performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews to classify them as positive or negative.

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning: Removes HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords. Converts text to lowercase and applies stemming.

Feature Extraction: Uses CountVectorizer to create a bag-of-words representation.

Model Training: Trains GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, and BernoulliNB classifiers.

Evaluation: Calculates and prints the accuracy of each model on the test set. The models are saved as .pkl files.

This script demonstrates basic text preprocessing and sentiment classification techniques.
